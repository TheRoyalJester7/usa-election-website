                              President Joe Biden is seeking another term in the White House, and with </br> former President Donald Trump's hat also in the ring, a 2020 rematch is a </br>real possibility. Democrats are expected to fall firmly behind Biden,</br> and Trump has held a stubborn lead in polls on the Republican side despite</br> several high-profile candidates aiming to unseat him.</br></br>
                                Here are the latest developments on the path to the 2024 election:

                            <p><strong>Background:</strong><span>First elected in 1972, Biden</span> served as a senator from </br> Delaware for 36 years before being elected vice president in 2008,</br> mounting a victory alongside former President Barack Obama. After</br> serving two terms as vice president, he took a brief hiatus from</br> government work before returning to run, and win, in 2020.</br></p>
                            <p><strong>Views</strong>: Biden's campaign is focused on the "battle for the soul of <br>America," doubling down on the central message of his campaign four <br> years ago. He said the question facing the nation is "whether, in the years <br> ahead, we have more freedom or less freedom, more rights or fewer."</p>

                    <P>Since his win in 2016, Trump has served as de facto leader of the <br> Republican Party, his influence still looming large in Washington. <br> However, after Trump-endorsed candidates suffered in the 2022 <br> midterms, and amid concerns around his age as well, speculation swirled <br> that there was an opening for a new leader to rise.

                    <p><strong>His views</strong> : Binkley <span>has said </span>he hopes to prioritize balancing the budget, <br> lowering health care costs, creating bipartisan immigration reform and <br> putting more community emphasis on education. Binkley is against <br> abortion rights. <span>His campaign</span> website says he was "thankful" when the <br> Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, but that a "culture of life" means <br> prioritizing adoption as well.</p>

                    <p><strong>Background</strong>: <span>Haley</span> started her political career in South Carolina's state <br> legislature, where she served for 6 years before mounting a successful <br> campaign for the governor's office in 2010. In 2016, former President <br> Donald Trump nominated Haley to be U.S. Ambassador to the United <br> Nations, a position she held for a year before unexpectedly stepping down <br> in 2018.</p>
                    <p><strong>Her views</strong>: <span>Haley </span>opposes abortion rights and has been a vocal supporter <br> of Israel in its ongoing war with Hamas. While on the campaign trail, she <br> has focused on illegal immigration, <span> advocating for</span> a return of the Trump- <br>era "Remain in Mexico" policy as well as the defunding of sanctuary cities. <br>  Haley has told voters she hopes to crack down on China's influence on the <br> U.S. economy.

                    <p><strong>Background</strong>: Prior to 2016, <span>Trump</span> dabbled in politics, often sounding <br> off on issues like the birther movement meant to cast doubt on former <br> President Barack Obama's citizenship and the case surrounding the now- <br>exonerated Central Park Five. However, he was still primarily known for <br> real estate and his forays into reality television, famously starring in "The <br> Apprentice." <br><br>In 2016, Trump won the White House, serving a full four-year term before <br> being defeated by Biden in his reelection bid.</p>
                    <p><strong>His views</strong>: The former president has, without evidence, centered much of <br> his campaign on the claim that his political enemies are fueling his <br> ongoing criminal cases. He has said he <span> would consider pardoning </span> <br> participants in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which his critics say was <br> inspired by his false claims of election fraud.</p>

                    <p><strong>His views</strong>: He is campaigning on a platform of fighting for the <span> "liberties <br> guaranteed by the Constitution,"</span> according to his campaign website. <br> During the COVID-19 pandemic, Kennedy opposed vaccine mandates,<br> calling them an infringement on individual liberty and at times <span>used the <br> Holocaust as a historical comparison.</span>  </p>
